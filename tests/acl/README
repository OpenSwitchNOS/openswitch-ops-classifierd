Adding exceptions
When a commands fails (the shells gets output in a non-show command) the library will try to determine the failure to raise a typed exception. To do so, it has to know what kind of errors the command may show. For example:
# asd aaa
% Unknown command
In the above scenario, we can identify this error using a regular expression that will match the unknown command output. To specify a new typed exception edit the file tools/vtysh_meta.py and modify the VTYSH_EXCEPTIONS_SPEC dictionary mapping the name of the new exception and a list of regular expressions for that error that will be used to try to identify the output of a command:
), (
    'IncompleteCommandException',
    [
        'Command incomplete',
    ]
)

To add a new command to the library, a developer needs to:
1.	Find if the context for the command is already defined on the dictionary.
2.	If it is not defined, it has to be added.
3.	Define the new command inside commands on the correct context.
4.	Execute the generator script. To do this:
i.	Go to the topology_lib_vtysh root folder.
ii.	Run tox which validates your script and prepares the py34 environment.
iii.	Run source .tox/py34/bin/activate.
iv.	Run ./tools/updatelib.
v.	Run deactivate.
